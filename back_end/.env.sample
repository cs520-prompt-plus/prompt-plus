# Specific Prompts
INPUT_SEMANTICS_FEEDBACK="Given a prompt, evaluate its *Input Semantics* based on the given criteria:\n\nPrompt: \"\"\"{}\"\"\"\n\nCriteria:\n1. \"\"\"*Intent and Context*: During a conversation with an LLM, the user would like to create the prompt via an alternate language, such as a textual short-hand notation for graphs, a description of states and state transitions for a state machine, a set of commands for prompt automation, etc. The intent of this pattern is to explain the semantics of this alternative language to the LLM so the user can write future prompts using this new language and its semantics.\"\"\"\n2. \"\"\"*Motivation*: Many problems, structures, or other ideas communicated in a prompt may be more concisely, unambiguously, or clearly expressed in a language other than English (or whatever conventional human language is used to interact with an LLM). To produce output based on an alternative language, however, an LLM needs to understand the language’s semantics.\"\"\"\n3. \"\"\"*Structure and Key Ideas*: Fundamental contextual statements: Contextual Statements When I say X, I mean Y (or would like you to do Y). The key structure of this pattern involves explaining the meaning of one or more symbols, words, or statements to the LLM so it uses the provided semantics for the ensuing conversation. This description can take the form of a simple translation, such as \"X\" means \"Y\". The description can also take more complex forms that define a series of commands and their semantics, such as \"when I say X, I want you to do\". In this case, \"X\" is henceforth bound to the semantics of \"take action\".\"\"\"\n4. \"\"\"*Consequences*: Although this pattern provides a powerful means to customize a user’s interaction with an LLM, it may create the potential for confusion within the LLM. As important as it is to clearly define the semantics of the language, it is also essential to ensure the language itself introduces no ambiguities that degrade the LLM’s performance or accuracy. For example, the prompt \"whenever I separate two things by commas, it means that the first thing precedes the second thing\" will likely create significant potential for ambiguity and create the potential for unexpected semantics if punctuation involving commas is used in the prompt.\"\"\"\n\nYour Response:"
